The BLS has a public Application Programming Interface (API) that is documented
on this [web page][200].

There are two versions of the API

1. Version 2.0 - requires registration and has more data
2. Version 1.0 - does not require registration but is more limited.

The Python [bls][1000] library is an unofficial library that makes it simple to
access the BLS API.
